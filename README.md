# QuickMath Kids

A math quiz app with a twist

## What sets it apart?

  * Audio-Based Questions: Instead of reading, kids listen to math problems, making learning more engaging and useful.
  * Text-to-Speech Technology: I have used a text-to-speech feature to convert written questions into spoken words.

## Features -  
  * Customizable Questions: You can tailor the questions to your child's specific needs and abilities.
  * Voice Customization: Adjust the voice and speed of the audio questions.
  * Endless Practice: Unlimited questions to keep kids challenged.
  * Flexible Learning: No time limits or pressure.
  * Pause and Quit: Take breaks or end the session at any time.
  * Detailed Result Screen: Track progress with a breakdown of correct and incorrect answers, time taken, and total questions attempted.
  * Share quizzes as PDFs via various social apps. The report includes detailed insights on correct and incorrect answers, accuracy, and time taken.

### This app is meant for kids who are under the age of 11.
### This app focuses on increasing the calculation time for math operations, and improving their auditory senses.

## This app is a work in progress, and I have lot in mind to improve on it.
